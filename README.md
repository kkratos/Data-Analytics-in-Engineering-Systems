## Description

In this Analysis, I used the US Accidents (2016 - 2022) with 2.9 million accidents records across all states in the US.

## Key questions answered in the analysis:

*  Is there a discernible pattern when accidents occur (day of the week, time)?
*  Which attributes contribute the most to accident occurrence?
*  Which major interstates are more accident prone?
*  Can we group together the states based on Severity and the Number of accidents?

## Dataset Used
*  [US Accidents (2016-2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

## Conclusions

*  From the analysis, it is observed that on weekdays around 6-9am and 3-6pm, which is usaually peak work hours is when majority of accidents have occured.
*  Extrement weather condition would be an obvious factor causing accidents but analysis shows 65% of accidents have occured on clear weather condition, giving insights into driving and traffic behaviour.
*  Major interstates on the west coast such as 5N, I-10E, I-5S have shown to accidents prone areast.
*  Performed clustering analysis to drive insight into states with high accident severity index, with california and florida having highest severity index compared to other states.
